Steganography:
Steganography is the practice of concealing or hiding one piece of information within another in a way that is difficult to detect. It is often used to hide secret data within digital images, audio files, text, or other forms of media. The goal of steganography is to make the hidden data as imperceptible as possible to an observer who may not be aware of its existence. This is in contrast to cryptography, which focuses on securing the content of a message.

Project Overview: Steganography Using Python

This project appears to be a basic implementation of steganography using the Python programming language. It involves hiding a secret message within an image and later decrypting it using a password. Here is a breakdown of the project:

Image Loading: The project begins by loading an image named "flower.jpg" using the OpenCV library, which is a popular library for computer vision and image processing.

User Input: The user is prompted to enter a secret message and a password. The secret message is what they want to hide within the image.

Character-to-Integer Mapping: Two dictionaries, d and c, are created to map characters to their ASCII values and vice versa. These mappings are used for encryption and decryption.

Encryption: The project processes each character of the input message and assigns its ASCII value to the corresponding pixel in the image. The pixel coordinates are updated as the loop iterates through the image, with the Red, Green, and Blue color channels being used to store the character data.

Saving the Encrypted Image: The modified image, now containing the hidden message, is saved as "encryptedImage.jpg" using OpenCV.

Opening the Encrypted Image: The os.startfile function is used to open the newly created encrypted image so that the user can see the result.

Decryption: The user is prompted to enter the password for decryption.

Decryption Process: If the entered password matches the one used for encryption, the project proceeds with decryption. It reads the characters from the RGB channels of the encrypted image and maps them back to their ASCII values. The decrypted message is reconstructed from these ASCII values and displayed to the user.
